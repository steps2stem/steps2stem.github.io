# Getting Started

You've already taken your first step -- finding this website! Whether you found
this through the 'Expanding Your Horizons' conference or you've gotten here on
your own, this is the place for all your early career building needs. Women and
girls can often feel alienated or unsupported by a culture that's dominated by
men, so we're here to encourage you to pursue what you love no matter who you
are. Whether you're 12 or 21, it's never too early or too late to start working
toward your dreams. Here are our tips for getting started working toward a
career in a science, technology, engineering, or math field.

1. Reach out to those you know in your life who have pursued a degree and/or
   career in any STEM field. This could include teachers, family members,
   friends, or acquaintances. Even people who you may feel like are unreachable,
   like mentors in the media, may respond if you send them an email asking for
   advice! Talk to as many people as you can, people wo are similar to and
   different from you, and gather diverse perspectives on the subject and draw
   on it as you make choices
2. Join groups that focus on what you're interested in--it may be a school club,
   a community initiative, a private organization, or just a gathering of
   friends who are also interested. If there isn't one already, start one
   yourself!
   [Makerspaces](http://library-maker-culture.weebly.com/what-are-they.html) are
   a fun way to get started--look and see if there's one in your area
3. Become a role model yourself. Offer help and support to other yound women
   interested in similar things--creating a network of friends and coworkers who
   are invested in the same things gives you power and reinforcement if you need
   it.
4. Don't be afraid to speak up! If a program you're in doesn't have many girls
   or women in it, or if a leader in your life is overlooking contributions that
   girls are making, try to diplomatically point out the problem. If you'd like,
   you can also offer to help fix the problem by advertising for more girls to
   join or speaking up for a point of view that may not be well represented.
5. Ask Google how. It can feel overwhelming to start in a field you don't know
   much about, but there are SO many resources out there. Just a simple internet
   search of 'how do circuits work?' could lead you on an hours-long adventure.
   There's always something to learn, and many ways to learn it (YouTube is
   particularly helpful if you like to learn visually or aurally).
