# Getting Started

You've already taken your first step--finding this website! Whether you found this through the 'Expanding Your Horizons' conference or you've gotten here on your own, this is the place for all your early career building needs. Women and girls can often feel alienated or unsupported by a culture that's dominated by men, so we're here to encourage you to pursue what you love no matter who you are. Whether you're 12 or 21, it's never too early or too late to start working toward your dreams. Here are our tips for getting started working toward a career in a science, technology, engineering, or math field. 

1. Reach out to those you know in your life who have pursued a degree and/or career in any STEM field. This could include teachers, family members, friends, or acquaintances. Even people who you may feel like are unreachable, like mentors in the media, may respond if you send them an email asking for advice! Talk to as many people as you can, people wo are similar to and different from you, and gather diverse perspectives on the subject and draw on it as you make choices. 

2. Join groups that focus on what you're interested in--it may be a school club, a community initiative, or just a gathering of friends who are also interested. If there isn't one already, start one yourself!
