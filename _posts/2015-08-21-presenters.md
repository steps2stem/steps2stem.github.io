# Meet the Presenters

This website was created as a result of the <a href="http://www.eyhn.org/">Expanding Your Horizons</a> conference in October of 2015, but the content of the page is applicable to girls everywhere looking for advice on how to get their start in STEM. The people listed below presented a workshop at the conference and those with contact information listed in their biography would be happy to answer any questions you have if you'd like to reach out!
