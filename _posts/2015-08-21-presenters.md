# Meet the Presenters

This website was created as a result of the <a href="http://www.eyhn.org/">Expanding Your Horizons</a> conference in October of 2015, but the content of the page is applicable to girls everywhere looking for advice on how to get their start in STEM. The people listed below presented a workshop at the conference and those with contact information listed in their biography would be happy to answer any questions you have if you'd like to reach out!

- _Gemma Anderson_ is a postdoctoral researcher in the Climate Modeling and Analysis group at LLNL. She received her PhD in theoretical astrophysics at the University of Sussex in the UK. Before that she did two masters in theoretical astrophysics, one at the University of Cambridge and the other at the University of Lancaster. She has been curious about how the universe (and everything in it) works from a very young age.
- _Jenny Knipe_: I knew from the time I took chemistry and calculus in high school that I wanted to be a chemical engineer. While attending West Virginia University I discovered the limitless opportunities and interdisciplinary nature of engineering- I was able to conduct experimental research in an immunology lab while studying about the role an engineer plays in everything from chemical production to pharmaceutical development to energy efficiency. I found my passion for material science during my PhD research while making “intelligent” polymer materials to deliver drugs to very specific regions of the body. Now I’m using my experimental skills and materials knowledge to create polymers that contain biological molecules as bioreactors, and we hope this material will increase the availability of alternative fuel sources!
- _Madison Martin_ is a graduate student in the Nuclear Engineering Program of the Materials Science Department at University of Florida. She is also a graduate scholar conducting her PhD research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Her research project includes the computational design, experimental coordination, and validation of short pulse laser driven opacity measurements. Madison is actively involved in the Lawrence Livermore Postdoc Association, American Nuclear Society, and UF’s Engineering Graduate Student Council. On a personal note, she loves reading, dancing, cycling, drinking tea, and doing yoga.
